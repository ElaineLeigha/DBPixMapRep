The files in the root directory are initial files from sprint 1. 
All updated forms of the project will be assigned new 
directories (ie. Sprint2, Sprint3, etc) so that we may revert
back to an older version in case of unexplainabled segfault
or wanting to start fresh with a different implementation.
